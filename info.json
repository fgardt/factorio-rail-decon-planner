  "description": "Provides a special deconstruction planner (ALT + F) that can mark entire rail segments for deconstruction at once. You can also just press the same hotkey while hovering a rail or signal to mark/unmark it for deconstruction.\n\nKnown limitation: deconstruction/deletion of ghosts is not possible.",
